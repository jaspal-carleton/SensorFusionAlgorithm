## Sensor fusion Software based on Principal Component Analysis ##

The purpose of the sensor fusion software is to calculate a single aggregate value from a stream of sensor data input by essentially adapting a sensor fusion algorithm. Sensor fusion algorithm in consideration is “A Simple Multi-Sensor Data Fusion Algorithm Based on Principal Component
Analysis” The algorithm takes row data from the sensors as inputs, perform Principal Component calculations and returns a value. The value generated by the algorithm is representative of the correct raw data from the sensors (i.e. there may be sensors giving wrong measures). The algorithm is executed every time new sensor data is received. The algorithm receives the data from all the sensors synchronously.
